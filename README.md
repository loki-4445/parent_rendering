# React Product Listing Example

This project demonstrates a simple React application that renders a list of products using a parent component (`App`) and a child component (`Test1`). Each product includes details such as an image, name, brand, and price.

## Key Concepts

- **Parent-Child Rendering:** The parent component (`App`) passes product data as props to the child component (`Test1`), which handles the rendering.
- **Props:** The parent sends an object containing product details to each `Test1` component.
